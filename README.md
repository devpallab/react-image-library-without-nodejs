1) About
#Implement a simple web app that allows browsing the Imgur gallery Consume the Imgur API:
https://api.imgur.com/
Documentation:
https://apidocs.imgur.com/

#Imgur's API exposes the entire Imgur infrastructure via a standardized programmatic interface. Using Imgur's API, you can do just about anything you can do on imgur.com, while using your programming language of choice. The Imgur API is a RESTful API based on HTTP requests and JSON responses. Here We have used : React 18 with redux pattern in the Front end and Express.js in the backend. 

2) Requirements
#show gallery images in a grid
of thumbnails;
• show image description in the thumbnail, top or bottom;
• allow selecting the gallery section: hot, top, user;
• allow specifying window and sort parameters;

3) Setup Instructions

i) Clone the repo.
ii) Please go to the project folder and type 'npm install' in terminal to install all the dependencies.
iii) Next run, 'npm start'.
i)Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser. This should redirect the page to http://localhost:3000/gallery
v) If required, Set IMGUR client ID : https://api.imgur.com/oauth2/addclient
We have alreay Set imgur client ID here: /backend/constants/constants

4) Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:
npm test
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
